                         <h2>Corbett Children’s Theater Origins</h2>
                         <p>For many years CCT served as the defacto theatre arts program for the Corbett School district. Starting in June of 1998 in Susan Scott’s back yard CCT worked with the local school district to provide a fun and educational experience for the students of eastern Multnomah County in the performing arts. </p>
                         <p>Corbett Children’s Theater started with a performance of Peter Pan practiced in Susan Scott’s back yard during the summer and performed in the Corbett School District’s Multi-purpose room that fall. Next was a performance of Shakespeare’s A Midsummer’s Nights Dream.</p>
                         <p>Within a couple years CCT was invited by the school district to use the Springdale School building as a storage and rehearsal space. Eventually, it became a performance space and during this time the families that make up CCT banded together to clean and restore the old school building.  Eventually a need for an earthquake retrofit of the building made that facility unavailable to CCT, shuffling us back up to use the Multi-purpose room until growth within the school district meant that they simply did not have room to accommodate Corbett Children’s Theater.</p>
                         <p>Since then we have found a home on Stark Street in Troutdale, down the hill from Mount Hood Community College, but through it all the mission has remained the same.  We exist to serve, stretch, facilitate, and educate the kids through the use of the theater arts.</p>

							<h1>Instructing</h1>
                         <p>The performing arts are about much more than simply perfoming. Portraying character is 
						more than pretending to be the character, it entails 
						understanding why the character would make the choices he or 
						she makes.&nbsp; As such it is an intro to psychology in the 
						same way that learning to dance provides a gateway to a lifetime of coordination and fitness.</p>
						 <p>Likewise, vocal instruction focuses on articulation, breath control, posture and numerous other disciplines that carry a lifetime of benefits including increased confidence, a firm foundation upon which one might be able to engage in public speaking, improved posture, and improved circulation due to more complete oxygenation in the blood stream.</p>

								<h1>Developing</h1>
                         <p>What do theatre kids learn? You might be surprised to learn that the primary things kids learn in a children’s theater are life skills like Teamwork, Problem Solving, Focus, and the Ability to Meet Deadlines.  Sure they learn to sing, dance, and act, and those are useful skills, but the ability to think on your feet and confidently face a room full of people are skills that every individual can benefit from.</p>
                         <p>Think of it this way; in the theatre a performer is portraying a character who reacts differently from the way they naturally react to the same stimuli and they have to do it with a roomful of people watching them, while knowing the director is evaluating their performance and at the same time that they can see the chaos that is taking place backstage while...</p>

								<h1>Promoting</h1>
                         <p>... Literacy in the East County.  A theatre arts education gets kids reading! Perhaps your child becomes interested because they love the fantasy of Tom Sawyer, Pippi Longstocking, or Charlette’s Web, but over time they are introduced to Charles Dickens (Oliver!, A Christmas Carol), and Victor Hugo (Les Miserables) or George Orwell (Animal Farm) and in the process they discover that reading is fun and can open new worlds of possibilities to them!</p>
                         <p>At Corbett Children’s Theater we offer multiple opportunities for the kids every year and every show is based on the written word.  Some are based on classic characters from great fiction like Alice in Wonderland, or Wizard of Oz.  Some are plays and musicals that were not adapted from literature, but either way children have the opportunity to discover the fun and wonder…</p>
