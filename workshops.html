          				The performing arts are about much more than simply perfoming. Portraying character is more than pretending to be the character, it entails understanding why the character would make the choices he or she makes.  As such it is an intro to psychology in the same way that learning to dance provides a gateway to a lifetime of coordination and fitness.
        			</p>
        			<p>
         				Likewise, vocal instruction focuses on articulation, breath control, posture and numerous other disciplines that carry a lifetime of benefits including increased confidence, a firm foundation upon which one might be able to engage in public speaking, improved posture, and improved circulation due to more complete oxygenation in the blood stream.

    		 		  What do theatre kids learn? You might be surprised to learn that the primary things kids learn in a children's theater are life skills like Teamwork, Problem Solving, Focus, and the Ability to Meet Deadlines. Sure they learn to sing, dance, and act, and those are useful skills, but the ability to think on your feet and confidently face a room full of people are skills that every individual can benefit from.

       				<p>
        			  Think of it this way; in the theatre a performer is portraying a character who reacts differently from the way they naturally react to the same stimuli and they have to do it with a roomful of people watching them, while knowing the director is evaluating their performance and at the same time that they can see the chaos that is taking place backstage while...

                  		At Corbett Children's Theater we offer multiple opportunities for the kids every year and every show is based on the written word. Some are based on classic characters from great fiction like Alice in Wonderland, or Wizard of Oz. Some are plays and musicals that were not adapted from literature, but either way children have the opportunity to discover the fun and wonder...
